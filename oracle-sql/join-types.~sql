-- >## Oracle SQL join mechanisms
-- >* HASH JOINS
-- >* Oracle database does a full-scan of the driving table, and buils a hash table 
-- >  in the memory.
-- >* The Hash Table is used to compare values with the other table.  
-- >* This is applied for smaller table or data sets.

-- >* NESTED LOOPS JOIN 
-- >* Oracle Database considers the smaller table as a Diriving Table and for every 
-- >  row in the driver table it searches for a matching value in the other table.
-- >* Indexes are used where ever possible.

-- >* SORT MERGE JOIN
-- >* Oracle database sorts the joining tables by the join column and merges the 
-- >  sorted row sources together. 
-- >* when the matches are found, they captured as the result set.
-- >* This concept is useful when join column data have no useful indexes 
-- >* Also this is used when the tables are very large.

-- >## Oracle Query Types
-- >### SUBQUERIES
-- >* Query inside a Query is a SUB-Query, The inner Query is in the WHERE clause
-- >```sql
select *
from   tab_main  tm
where  tm.id = (select t1.id
                from   tab1 t1
                      ,tab2 t2
                where  t1.id = t2.id);    
-- >```


-- >### INLINE VIEWS
-- >* They are subqueries in the FROM clause rather than in the WHERE clause
-- >```sql
select *
from   (select t1.id
        from   tab1 t1
              ,tab2 t2
        where  t1.id = t2.id);     
-- >```
